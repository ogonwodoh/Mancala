# Mancala
A command line game of Mancala between 2 players. GUI coming soon!

All the necessary files for this game of Mancala are encapsulated in a packaged called 'Mancala'
The files of this package are:
MancalaNode.java
MancalaBoard.java
MancalaGame.java

MancalaGame contains a main method where two players can play Mancala with each other, by picking 'nodes' in the board to move, seeing the state of the board after each player's move, and choosing their next steps.

MancalaBoard is the class implementation of the Mancala board

MancalaNode is the class implementation of the holes in the board

Instructions on the general idea of how to play Mancala can be found here:http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-play-MANCALA/
NOTE: There are variations on how to play Mancala, so my implementation may not exactly match the instructions in the link above.

Enjoy!
